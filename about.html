				I'm an aspiring Aerospace Engineer as well as being somewhat of a tech guru. Currently working on smaller-scale computer projects, such as RC-plane autonomy/autopilot, Cryptocurrency mining, and minor robotics projects. Know HTML, JavaScript, CSS, some C++, as well as some basic Command Line Linux. Oh my name is Spencer Buchanan by the way.
